Q1. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.

Ans:-for loop:- A for loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to repeat a block of code. The for loop uses a counter variable that is initialized to a starting value and incremented or decremented at each iteration. The loop continues until the counter variable reaches a certain end value.
#Example of for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

while loop:- A while loop is typically used when you don't know how many times you want to repeat a block of code. Instead of using a counter variable, a while loop uses a condition that is tested at the beginning of each iteration. The loop continues until the condition is no longer true.
#Example of while loop
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Q2. Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for
and while loop.

Ans:- #Using a for loop

# Calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum += i

print("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)

# Calculate the product of the first 10 natural numbers
product = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    product *= i

print("The product of the first 10 natural numbers is:", product)

#Using a while loop

# Calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
sum = 0
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    sum += i
    i += 1

print("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:", sum)

# Calculate the product of the first 10 natural numbers
product = 1
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    product *= i
    i += 1

print("The product of the first 10 natural numbers is:", product)

Q3. Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.

Ans:- # Input the number of units consumed
units = int(input("Enter the number of units consumed: "))

# Calculate the electricity bill based on the tariff rates
if units <= 50:
    bill = units * 0.50
elif units <= 150:
    bill = 25 + (units - 50) * 0.75
elif units <= 250:
    bill = 100 + (units - 150) * 1.20
else:
    bill = 220 + (units - 250) * 1.50

# Add additional charges and taxes
surcharge = bill * 0.20  # 20% surcharge for bills over Rs. 1,500
taxes = bill * 0.05  # 5% tax on the total bill amount
total_bill = bill + surcharge + taxes

# Display the electricity bill
print("Electricity Bill = Rs. {:.2f}".format(total_bill))

Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each
number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print
that list.

The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per
unit, for the next 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units, the user will
be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit.

You are required to take the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input.

Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is
310, the total electricity bill should be 2250.

Ans:- Here's a program that creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100, calculates the cube of each number, and appends the number to a list if the cube is divisible by 4 or 5:

# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100
num_list = list(range(1, 101))

# Calculate the cube of each number and append to a list if divisible by 4 or 5
result_list = []
for num in num_list:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_list.append(num)

print(result_list)

here's a program to calculate the electricity bill for a household based on the number of units consumed

# Input the number of units consumed
units = int(input("Enter the number of units consumed: "))

# Calculate the electricity bill based on the tariff rates
if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 4.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = 450 + (units - 100) * 6
elif units <= 300:
    bill = 1050 + (units - 200) * 10
else:
    bill = 3050 + (units - 300) * 20

# Display the electricity bill
print("Electricity Bill = Rs.", bill)

Q5. Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string.

string = "I want to become a data scientist"

Ans:- string = "I want to become a data scientist"

# Define a function to filter and count vowels in a string
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

# Call the function on the given string
num_vowels = count_vowels(string)

# Display the number of vowels in the string
print("Number of vowels:", num_vowels)
